% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section{Illustration}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\todo{Find reference}
Suppose we have asset returns $\returns \sim \normaldist(\meanvec, \covmat)$. Suppose we have CARA utility $\utility(w) = - e^{-\gamma w}$ for some risk aversion parameter $\gamma > 0$. By conventional arguments,
\begin{equation}
	\E[\utility(W)] = -\exp\left\{ -\gamma w_0 \left[ \riskfreerate + \portfolio^\top (\meanvec - \riskfreerate \onevec_\numassets) - \frac{\gamma w_0}{2} \portfolio^\top \covmat \portfolio \right] \right\}
	\label{eq:CARAUtility}
\end{equation}

Fixing a level $\alpha \in (0,1)$, it is well known the the score function $S(x,y) = (\ind\{x \ge y\} - \alpha)(x - y)$ will lead to the $\alpha$-quantile. Hence, \eqref{eq:OrangeRiskIC} solves explicitly to
\begin{equation}
	\VaR_\alpha(\portfolio)
	= \argmin_{v'} \E[\riskloss(v', \wealth_t^{\portfolio})]
	= w_0\left(\riskfreerate + \portfolio^\top (\meanvec - \riskfreerate \onevec_\numassets ) + \sqrt{2} \Erf^{-1}(2\alpha - 1)  \sqrt{  \portfolio^{\top} \covmat \portfolio }   \right)
	\label{eq:CARAVaR}
\end{equation}
Suppose we have the constraint set $\riskmeasureconstraints = \{ v' \in \R : v' \le w_0 \bar{v} \}$ for some constant $\bar{v} \le 0$. Putting everything together, we reduce the optimization problem to

\begin{maxi}
	{\portfolio \in \R^\numassets}{ \riskfreerate + \portfolio^\top (\meanvec - \riskfreerate \onevec_\numassets) - \frac{\gamma w_0}{2} \portfolio^\top \covmat \portfolio }{}{}
	\addConstraint{ \riskfreerate + \portfolio^\top (\meanvec - \riskfreerate \onevec\numassets ) + \sqrt{2} \Erf^{-1}(2\alpha - 1)  \sqrt{  \portfolio^{\top} \covmat \portfolio } \le \bar{v} }
\end{maxi}

The constraint $v \in \riskmeasureconstraints$ behaves like an \emph{individual rationality} constraint in the principal-agent literature.
\footnote{
	Strictly speaking, we should formulate the individual rationality constraint in terms of the agent's utility function. In our current setup, it would take the form $\E[ \riskloss(v', \wealth^{\portfolio}) ] \ge \underbar{\riskloss}$ for some constant $\underbar{\riskloss}$.
}


\todo{Find reference for risk preference difference in principal-agent lit}
Our highly stylized principal-agent problem here illustrates the tension between the principal (``portfolio manager'') and the agent (``risk manager''). Under this stylized illustration, the principal is a mean-variance optimizer while the agent is a mean-standard deviation optimizer. Up to the VaR constraint of $\bar{v}$, the principal and the agent have the same first moment term $\riskfreerate + \pi^\top( \meanvec - \riskfreerate \onevec_n)$ in their preferences. Both the principal and the agent agree to choose portfolios $\portfolio$ that achieves a high mean wealth. However, the principal and the agent have different risk aversions. Let's assume no wealth effects for simplicity, so say $w_0 = 1$. Note that $\Erf^{-1} \le 0$ on $(-1, 0]$. Thus for conventional values of $\alpha$ (e.g.\ $0.05$), it is ensured that $\Erf^{-1}(2 \alpha - 1) < 0$. Rewriting as $\sqrt{2} \Erf^{-1}(2 \alpha - 1) \sqrt{\portfolio^\top \covmat \portfolio} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{2 \sqrt{2} \Erf^{-1}(2 \alpha - 1) }{ \sqrt{\portfolio^\top \covmat \portfolio} } \portfolio^\top \covmat \portfolio $, we can reinterpret the agent to have a risk aversion parameter of $2 \sqrt{2} \Erf^{-1}(2 \alpha - 1) / \sqrt{\portfolio^\top \covmat \portfolio}$ that simultaneously depends on the level $\alpha$ and also on the portfolio volatility $\sqrt{\portfolio^\top \covmat \portfolio}$. Thus, our setup here illustrates one of the core conflicts between the principal and the agent whereby they have strictly different risk preferences. Of course, without the constraint $v' \in \riskmeasureconstraints$, there will be no conflict between the principal and the agent.
